## What do I need to do to randomize Sekiro?

See full instructions on [the setup page].

## What does randomization do to this game?

1. All item locations can be randomized, including those in the overworld, in
   shops, and dropped by enemies.
   Treasure Carp locations are turned off by default, but can enabled.
   Most locations can contain items from other worlds,
   and any items from your world can appear in other players' worlds.

2. By default, all enemies and bosses except for Headless are randomized.
   This can be disabled by setting "Randomize Enemies" to false.

There are also options that can make playing the game more convenient or
bring a new experience, like removing the Headless-induced slow walk or
shuffling skills between Esoteric Texts. Check out the Template YAML or the 
Option Builder in the Archipelago Launcher for more.

## What's the goal?

Your goal is to find the "Divine Dragon's Tears" item and achieve
one of the endings requiring this item.

## Do I have to check every item in every area?

Sekiro has nearly 750 item locations, which is a lot of checks for a single run!
But you don't necessarily need to check all of them. Locations that you can
potentially miss, such as rewards for failable quests or areas that become 
unavailabe during the game state changes, will _never_ have items required for 
any game to progress. The following types of locations are also guaranteed not 
to contain progression items by default:

* **Hidden:** Locations that are particularly difficult to find, such as in
  crawl spaces, down hidden drops, behind walls and so on. Does not include 
  large locations like Ashina Outskirts after the Central Forces invasion.

* **Upgrade:** Locations that contain non-unique upgrade materials for
  prosthetic tools in vanilla.

* **Miscellaneous:** Locations that contain generic stackable items in vanilla,
  such as sugars, mibu balloons, resistance buffs and so on.

You can customize which locations are guaranteed not to contain progression
items by setting the `exclude_locations` field in your YAML to the [location
groups] you want to omit. For example, this is the default setting but without
"Hidden" so that hidden locations can contain progression items:

[location groups]: /tutorial/Sekiro/locations/en#location-groups

```yaml
Shadows Die Twice:
  exclude_locations:
    - Upgrade
    - Miscellaneous
```

This allows _all_ non-missable locations to have progression items, if you're in
for the long haul:

```yaml
Shadows Die Twice:
  exclude_locations: [ ]
```

## What if I don't want to do the whole game?

If you want a shorter Sekiro randomizer experience, you can exclude entire
regions
from containing progression items. The items and enemies from those regions will
still be included in the randomization pool, but none of them will be mandatory.

However, since Sekiro requires you to still reach the end of the game,
most regions will still need to be traversed, they will just not have any
mandatory checks.\
Below you can find an example of regions that
technically do not have to be traversed at all to complete the game in the
randomizer.

**Please note that adding too many exclusions will make the apworld fail
generation as there will not be enough filler items to accomodate them.**

```yaml
Shadows Die Twice:
  exclude_locations:
    # Exclude non-required regions
    - Sunken Valley
    - Sunken Valley Passage
    # Note the formatting here, otherwise the generation will fail!
    - "Hirata Estate (Father's Bell Charm)"
    - Ashina Outskirts (Central Forces)

    # Default exclusions
    - Hidden
    - Upgrade
    - Miscellaneous
```

## Where can I learn more about Sekiro locations?

Location names have to pack a lot of information into very little space. To
better understand them, check out the [location guide], which explains all the
names used in locations and provides more detailed descriptions for each
individual location.
