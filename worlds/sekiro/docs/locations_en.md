## Location Groups

The Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice randomizer supports a number of location group names, which
can be used in YAML options like `exclude_locations` to refer to many locations
at once:

  Mostly boss drops. Ideal for setting as priority locations.

* **Incense:** Locations that contain items required to reach the Divine Realm (Fountainhead Palace) in vanilla.

* **Boss Rewards:** Boss drops. Bosses are strong enemies that drop memories.

* **Miniboss Rewards:** Miniboss drops. Minibosses are enemies with boss bars that do not drop memories.

* **Hostile:** Drops from regular enemies or NPCs that are hostile to you.

  or from non-violent interaction.

* **Miscellaneous:** Locations that contain generic stackable items such as sugars, mibu balloons, resistance buffs and so on.

* **Hidden:** Locations that are particularly difficult to find, such as in crawl spaces,
  down hidden drops, behind walls and so on. 

* **Offering Box:** Locations that contain items which move into the Offering Box after
  becoming unavailable elsewhere.

## Understanding Location Names

All locations begin with an abbreviation indicating their general region. Most
locations have a set of landmarks that are used in location names to keep them
short.

General notes:

* "Miniboss" refers to enemies with unique health bars that do not drop memories.

* NPC quest items are always in the first location you can get them _without_
  killing the NPC or ending the quest early.

* Currently the logic assumes you send Jinzaemon to Doujun in the Abandoned Dungeon and Kotaro to Anayama.
  Therefore the locations for Jinza's Jizo Statue and the Taro Persimmon are deemed unreachable and not generated.
